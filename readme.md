# üöó Vehicle Counter using YOLO

A real-time vehicle counting system developed to process video feeds using a combination of deep learning and computer vision. This project leverages the powerful **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model for object detection, with efficient implementation handled by **OpenCV** and **PyTorch**.

The system is designed to track vehicles as they pass through a predefined line in a video stream, providing a live count.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Object Detection:** Detects vehicles in real-time using the **YOLO** model.
* **Accurate Counting:** Tracks and counts vehicles as they cross a user-defined virtual line.
* **PyTorch Backend:** Utilizes **PyTorch** for fast and efficient model inference.
* **OpenCV Integration:** Employs **OpenCV** for seamless video processing and visualization.
* **Customizable:** Easily adjust the counting line and video source to fit different scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* **Python:** The core language for the project.
* **PyTorch:** The deep learning framework.
* **OpenCV:** The computer vision library.
* **YOLO:** The object detection model.
